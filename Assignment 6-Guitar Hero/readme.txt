Planned on working with Chris Edwards van Muijen, but on Saturday when
planned to start programming together he realized he could not partner 
with anyone because he received a grade of 14 for the last assignment
due to it being handed in a day late. 

I considered listing RuntimeException.java as a dependency in 
RingBuffer.java, but noticed that it was not mentioned as a dependency
Quote.java. I interpret this to mean that the RuntimeException class 
is included in the basic java package and therefore it is not necessary
to include it in the list of dependencies.
